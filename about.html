  <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      1,650 origami butterflies.
    <p>
      10,000 minutes of folding.
    </p>
      The fleeting beauty and connection in the public realm.
    <p>
      Sometimes these are beautiful because they don't last. A
      conversation with a stranger who you'll never meet again. A butterfly that 
      sits for a moment on a nearby flower.
    </p>
      But often, beauty and connection in public spaces are short-lived 
      or never reached because our modern world doesn't prioritize them.
    <p>
      This installation invites you to contemplate the fleeting beauty
      and human connection present in our public spaces. Things we reach
      for but can't fully touch.
    </p>
      Both butterflies and paper are short-lasting in the moments they
      occupy. Paper can become anything, even a butterfly,
      but only with human intention and presence.
